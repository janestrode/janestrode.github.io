            <h1>About the Artist</h1>
            <p>Jane Strode is an undergraduate student at the University of Colorado, Boulder. She will be graduating in the Spring of 2026 with a BFA in Drawing and Painting and a minor in Art History and Creative Technology and Design. </p>
            <p>Strode's art is colorful, expressive, and emotional. She is interested in specific moments and feelings, whether that is within herself or with the people and things she loves. Strode works mainly with oil paint and oil pastel. In the past, she was interested in realistic graphite drawings, but has since transitioned to working with color. </p>
            <p>Strode's most recent work has explored physical touch and closeness, and the ways in which it can bring comfort while at the same time having the power to devolve into something hostile and destructive.  </p>
