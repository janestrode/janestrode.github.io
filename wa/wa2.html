    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>My name is <strong>Jane</strong> <em>(she/her)</em>. I grew up in Boulder and am now a senior studying art practices. I like listening to music, going thrifting, and I'm obsessed with fish and birds.
        My goals for this course are to learn how to code with more confidence and 
        to impliment creativity into web design.  </p>
    <p> Here is my favorite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiKbKRcsBCw">youtube video.</a> Its a performace by Raye from the Brit Awards and it actually blows my mind every time I watch it.</p>
